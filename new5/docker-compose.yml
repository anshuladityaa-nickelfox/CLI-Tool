Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up a web service, a Postgres database, Redis, and Celery:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python app.py
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
      - celery
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/database
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
      - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
      - CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis

  celery:
    build: .
    command: celery -A app worker --loglevel=info
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    depends_on:
      - redis
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
      - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
      - CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0

volumes:
  db-data:
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file defines four services:

1. `web`: This is the main web application. It's built from the current directory (`.`) and runs the `app.py` file. It depends on the `db`, `redis`, and `celery` services.
2. `db`: This is the Postgres database. It uses the official Postgres image and sets up a database with the specified user, password, and database name.
3. `redis`: This is the Redis service. It uses the official Redis image.
4. `celery`: This is the Celery worker. It's built from the current directory (`.`) and runs the Celery worker with the specified broker and result backend.

The `volumes` section defines a named volume `db-data` that's used to persist the Postgres database data.

You can customize this `docker-compose.yml` file to fit your specific needs. For example, you can change the `command` for the `web` service to run a different command, or you can add more environment variables to the `environment` section.

To use this `docker-compose.yml` file, create a new directory for your project and add the following files:

* `app.py`: This is the main application file.
* `requirements.txt`: This lists the dependencies required by your application.
* `Dockerfile`: This defines how to build the Docker image for your application.

Here's an example `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This `Dockerfile` uses the official Python 3.9 image, sets up the working directory, installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, copies the application code, and sets the default command to run `app.py`.

Once you have these files in place, you can run the following command to build and start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build the Docker images and start the services in detached mode. You can then access the web application at `http://localhost:8000`.
